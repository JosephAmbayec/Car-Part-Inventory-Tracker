Car Parts Tracker by The Car Guys is an inventory management application for auto parts. Featured on the home/landing page are 5 buttons.

The first button "**Add a Car part**" brings up a form and prompts the user to enter the details of a new part to be added to the database

The second button "**Find a Car Part**" brings up a form and prompts the user to enter a part number and returns the part from the database

The third button "**Show all Car Parts**" returns the contents of the database formatted nicely in a table, 

The fourth button "**Update a Car Part**" brings up a form and prompts the user to enter the details of a part to be updated in the database

The fifth button "**Delete a Car Part**" brings up a form and prompts the user to enter the part number and deletes the specified part from the database

By default there are four options in the **navbar**, **home**, **about us**, **login** and **register**.

Featured below the navigation bar is a language drop down which lets user choose between English or French.

Once a user is logged in, they are presented with the ability to create new projects.

A **project** can be thought of as a cart, logged in users can add parts from the database into a project in order to better organize their parts.

That about sums up the functionality of Car Parts Tracker, we hope you enjoy your experience using the application.
