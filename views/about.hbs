    <h1>Who are The Car Guys?</h1>

    <p>
        We are a group of 2nd year Computer Science students with an interest in the 
        automotive industry. Our shared interests lead us to come up with an
        inventory tracker so car enthusiasts alike can organize and keep track of
        their projects.

    <h3>Our motivation and inspiration</h3>

    <p>
        Our motivation for this project was the lack of free user friendly
        inventory management systems. There's already a fair amount of
        inventory trackers out there, however most of them are only available
        for a ridiculous monthly fee. The handful of free inventory 
        trackers offer limited functionality or have an ugly and terribly
        designed interface. Our inspiration for the design was a combination
        of what we gathered from a few of the paid inventory tracking systems
        and features we came up with after group discussions.
